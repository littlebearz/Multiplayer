Some vanilla features are currently not available in multiplayer:

**Caravan splitting and world incidents related to caravans**  
Any events potentially changing the contents of caravans would need to either pause the planet or have all caravan interfaces be dynamic. The former is undesirable and the latter would need lots of work.  
Disabled incidents: caravan meeting and caravan demand (ambushes work)

**Comms console**  
Calling other factions is currently disabled as it's a seldom used feature and syncing it would require quite a lot of work.  
Trading with orbital ships works.

**Faction and settlement naming**

**Ransom demand event**
