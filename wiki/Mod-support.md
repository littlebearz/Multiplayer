The sheer variety of RimWorld mods makes supporting all of them in multiplayer a difficult task. Currently there's a number of mods which work, but many will require manual compatibility patches.

**All XML mods are supported and work correctly.**  
You can highlight XML mods by holding Shift in the ingame mod list (after enabling Multiplayer, of course).  
Examples: _More Trade Ships, Increased Stack, P-Music, EPOE_

These types of mods have a high chance of working:
- Only affecting game creation, as multiplayer is hosted from existing saves  
Examples: _Prepare Carefully_
- With new interfaces not affecting gameplay logic  
Examples: _Numbers, Color Coded Mood Bar_
- With new gameplay logic but no custom interfaces  
Examples: _RT Fuse_
- Not affecting gameplay (e.g. mod managers)

Modded desyncs are usually caused by mods adding new GUI elements (although that's not always the case). Such mods are currently unsupported. An API and a compatibility guide will be released soon.
