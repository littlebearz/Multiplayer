Although many of the edge cases have been covered, the game state can still occasionally desynchronize. Most of the time it happens due to unsynchronized interface interactions.

Make sure all players have the **same versions** of their mods installed, enabled in the same order and configured the same way. Everyone should be playing on the same version of RimWorld.

Checking game's file integrity on Steam can also help with desyncs.

**You can help with desync patching by direct messaging me desync files on Discord.** They are generated automatically on each desync and located in _MpDesyncs_ folder, next to [game's saves folder](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Save_file#Save_file_locations). The most useful ones are the very first ones after a period of everything behaving correctly. Desyncs after trying to resync are also useful, because they indicate there could be a problem with the arbiter.

You might need to host the file on some other site (Dropbox, Mediafire) as Discord's filesize limit is 8MB.

Please also describe what you were doing (clicking, seeing) just prior to getting the desync. Any bit of information more than just "i got desynced plz fix" helps.

Only the latest 10 desync files are kept, so you don't need to clear the folder.
