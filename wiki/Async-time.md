You might've noticed that there are time control buttons placed around the interface in some weird places.

The async time feature separates the time on every map and the planet. It allows the game to keep being played while a pausing event is happening on one of the maps (i.e. trading, caravan forming). It's also done in preparation for future PVP settlements.

As a result, the world map in multiplayer acts conceptually as more of a game board than a planet, because global time and seasons don't really make sense in this system. Some incidents like Eclipses and Solar Flares also now happen per map.
