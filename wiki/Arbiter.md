The Arbiter is a game instance which runs in the background and can start with the server to aid with desync solving.

Being the "neutral side", it helps with deciding which client is the culprit in a desync, especially when there are only 1 or 2 players online.

It's enabled by default, but runs as a separate process, so it shouldn't affect the game's performance too much.
