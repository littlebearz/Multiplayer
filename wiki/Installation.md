* Download the latest Multiplayer.zip file from here: https://github.com/Zetrith/Multiplayer/releases
* Unpack the downloaded file into the _Mods_ folder in RimWorld's installation folder
* The mod's folder should be _Mods/Multiplayer/_ (make sure it's not: _Mods/Multiplayer/Multiplayer/_)
* In the ingame mod list, enable and order the mod **right below** Core (Core->Multiplayer->other mods)

* Connect and play using the Multiplayer button

If the button still doesn't appear make absolutely sure you've downloaded the mod from https://github.com/Zetrith/Multiplayer/releases

You can safely delete the Multiplayer folder if you are updating the mod.

(The mod isn't available on the Steam Workshop yet)
