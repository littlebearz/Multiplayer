**How do I install this thing?**  
**I've installed the mod, but don't have the Multiplayer button in the main menu. What to do?**  
See [Installation](https://github.com/Zetrith/Multiplayer/wiki/Installation)

**Is the mod available through Steam?**  
Not yet. A Workshop release will be available after the mod gets more stable.

**Does it work between different operating systems?**  
Yes, there should be no problems with cross-os games.

**Is it one faction only?**  
Currently everyone is cooperatively playing exactly the same game, with same maps, in the same faction.  
Two player factions fighting will be more difficult to implement, because the game is hard coded in many places to only support one user-controlled faction. Nonetheless, PVP is still one of the main goals.

**Are mods supported?**  
See [Mod support](https://github.com/Zetrith/Multiplayer/wiki/Mod-support)

**How do I save a multiplayer game?**  
You can save using the "Save replay" button in ESC menu or using the /autosave chat command. You can also wait for the regular autosave.  
Multiplayer saves are called replays and are separate from the vanilla ones. They are listed under the Host tab in the main Multiplayer menu.

**Is dev mode supported in multiplayer?**  
[Debug mode](https://github.com/Zetrith/Multiplayer/wiki/Debug-mode) is available since version 0.4.

**Is the storyteller enabled?**  
Yes.

**Can I change my ingame username?**  
The username can be changed in the mod options.

**Can I play singleplayer with the mod enabled?**  
Singleplayer games should be unaffected.

**Which RimWorld version should I be using?**  
The same one as the host. The latest version is always recommended though.

**What is the maximum amount of players online?**  
The mod is very lightweight and the number is probably quite big, but the default and recommended max is 8.

**Where can I find X on my computer?**  
For Windows:
- RimWorld installation: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\
- Game's log file: [rimworld]\RimWorldWin64_Data\output_log.txt
- Arbiter's log file: [rimworld]\arbiter_log.txt
- Game's data (saves, replays and desync files): %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\

Note that log files reset on game's startup.
